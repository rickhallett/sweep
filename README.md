# sweep 🧹

Memory consolidation and synthesis CLI for cognitive maintenance.

## What

Tools for maintaining HAL's memory files:
- **Consolidation sweeps** — Process memory files, identify patterns, extract insights
- **Synthesis** — Deduplicate, merge, and prune stale entries
- **Audit trail** — Track all consolidation operations

## Why

Memory accumulates. Without consolidation, it becomes noise. Sweep keeps memory lean and useful.

## Commands (Planned)

```bash
sweep scan       # Scan for consolidation opportunities
sweep merge      # Merge redundant entries
sweep prune      # Remove stale/obsolete entries
sweep audit      # Show consolidation history
sweep status     # Report memory health metrics
```

## Status

Scaffolded. CLI structure defined, implementation pending.
